# czard
A little project that's like an online Cards Against Humanity.

### Features
- [ ] Github Pages website with VueJS.
- [ ] Custom decks (format for making them in a file, interface for creating said files).
- [ ] Easy to use and clean interface.
- [ ] No sign in necessary, just create a room and send an invite.
- [ ] Account system and deck publishing system for sharing and creating decks.

### Future propositions
- [ ] Custom game, room, and deck formats.
- [ ] Image support in cards.
- [ ] Maybe, just maybe a custom logic language used for card interactions.

### Running the project
If you'd like to run the very little amount of content this project has to offer:
```
npm install # install necessary components
```

To run a development version:
```
npm run serve # locally hosted and hot-reloaded development environment
```

To build a production version:
```
npm run build # its in the name dude
```

Lint my garbage code:
```
npm run lint # uses the js standard format
```
